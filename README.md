## Introduction

This assessment gauges your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and your ability to apply these concepts in a practical manner. While you are encouraged to be creative with your projects and implementations, keep in mind the specific topics that you are required to demonstrate understanding of, and make sure your project incorporates them appropriately.

## Objectives

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

## Goal

Create a function named getLearnerData() that accepts these values as parameters, in the order listed: (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]), and returns the formatted result, which should be an array of objects as described above.

You may use as many helper functions as you see fit.
